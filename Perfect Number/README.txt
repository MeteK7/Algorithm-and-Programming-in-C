What is a perfect number?
If half of the sum of a number's positive divisors is equal to itself, the number is a perfect number.
An example:
The positive divisors of number 6 are 1,2,3,6.
The sum of these positive divisors is 1+2+3+6=12.
Half of the sum of these positive divisors is 6 and it is equal to that number.
So, 6 is a perfect number.
